## About This Project  

**React Music Player** is a modern and responsive web application built with React. It allows users to play, pause, skip forward/backward, and manage songs with a clean interface. The app uses React Router for navigation, Context API for global state management, and also includes a real-time equalizer for a better experience. With a smooth design and responsive layout, this project shows how to build a full-featured music player using React concepts.
